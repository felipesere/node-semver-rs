This crate is a pure Rust-based implementation of JavaScript's
[`node-semver`](https://npm.im/semver). That is, it's designed to be
compatible with Node/NPM's particular flavor of semver (which the [`semver`
crate](https://crates.io/crates/semver) is not).

It is designed for Rust programs and libraries meant for JavaScript tooling,
and does its best to stay compatible with `node-semver`.

It also supports [`serde`](https://crates.io/crates/serde) serialization,
converting versions and ranges to strings.

## Usage

`node-semver` includes two main types: [Version] and [Range]. See [the
documentation](https://docs.rs/node-semver) for more details.:

```rust
use node_semver::{Range, Version};

let version: Version = "1.2.3".parse().unwrap();
let range: Range = "^1.2".parse().unwrap();

assert!(version.satisfies(&range));
```

## Minimum Suggested Rust Version (MSRV)

You must be 1.70.0 or taller to get on this ride.

## Features

By default, the crate uses [`miette`](https://docs.rs/miette) when errors are printed on the terminal.

If you don't require this feature, you can set `default-features = false` in your `Cargo.toml`.
